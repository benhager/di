# di - [D]ownload and [I]nstall Mac apps

If you buy apps from the Mac App Store, then getting updates is fairly easy. (For all of its problems, the Mac App Store does updates pretty well.)

However, there are ***a lot*** of good apps -- maybe even the majority of good apps -- which aren’t available in the Mac App Store. 

Installing those apps means:

1.	going to Google to find the appropriate website (not always easy because, especially if app has a common name, or if the search results have a lot of other download sites before the official site.)

2.	finding the download link (not always easy)

3.	downloading the app (easy, but sometimes slow, due to a slow server or slow Internet connection)

4.	unzipping .zip files (or tbz files, etc) or mounting .dmg files, then copying them to /Applications/ (and un-mounting DMGs)

Most apps have an update system, **but they usually want to update at the least convenient time: right after you launch them, when you are trying to use them for something.**

Wouldn’t it be better if you could check for updates right after an app _quits?_ Or check in the middle of the night or when your computer isn’t in use?

That’s what these scripts allow you to do.

(Note: _Technically_ these scripts do three things: Download, Install, and _Update_; but I didn’t want to prefix them with [dui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence) and `diu` seemed awkward to type, so I went with a `di` prefix.)

## “But what about…?”

There are lots of other ways to do this.

[MacUpdate Desktop](http://www.macupdate.com/desktop) might be the easiest to use, but it’s $40/year, and seems to miss some apps that I use. Also, there’s no good way to tell it when to run, so it doesn’t solve the interruption problem. Also: although I have been working on these scripts for a long time, and I still use MacUpdate, there was a very troubling “experiment” which seemed to happen recently where MacUpdate was bundling additional software with downloads *and claiming it was a feature.* (See [Has MacUpdate fallen to the adware plague?](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/news/2015/11/has-macupdate-fallen-to-the-adware-plague/)) Every one of my scripts so far (and for the foreseeable future) downloads directly from the official website.

[Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) does the same thing that [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) does, except for regular apps. Cask solves the automation problem, in that you can schedule it to run whenever you want, but the whole system is built around the idea that someone else (other than you) will notice when an update to an app is available, and then submit it to the maintainers. That might make sense if an app doesn’t have its own update system, but for those that do, why not use them directly?

[AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) is a super-powerful system that can probably do far more than my system can. But it’s also a lot more complicated.

I wanted something different than all of the above.

## My Way

_Most_ third-party Mac apps use [Sparkle](http://sparkle-project.org/) to check for updates. 

Sparkle uses a standardized XML-based RSS feed that includes all of the information that I need to check to see if I have the latest version of an app, or a quick way to install the latest version of an app if it isn’t installed.

I can check the Sparkle feed for the latest version of the app and compare it to the locally installed version using Unix tools which come standard with every Mac. In almost all cases, you should be able to take one of these `di` scripts and run it on a freshly-installed Mac and it will download & install the latest version for you.

## Multiple Macs?

Have several Macs? You can run `di` scripts over `ssh` and update any Mac you want, without needing to worry about doing separate setup for each one.

If you are behind a slow or metered Internet connection, or do you just not want to re-download each app update separately, you can easily sync your `~/Downloads/` folder using [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/). Each `di` script is designed to check `~/Downloads/` to see if the latest version of the app is already downloaded there and ready to be installed. (This also means that large downloads which are interrupted before they are finished can be resumed by re-running the script.)

## No Maintenance  (almost)

One of the best parts of this system is that once it is setup, it should not need any more work. The next time the script is run after an app is updated, it will notice the new version using the app’s own update mechanism. Then the rest of the process will continue as before. 

I’ve been using these scripts for a few years, and so far the only time they break is if a new major version of an app (i.e. version 5 vs version 6) uses a different Sparkle feed. That *usually* only requires updating one line of the script to point to the new feed URL.

## What’s Left

One of my personal favorite parts of this system is that when the script is finished, you are left with the original download which has been named in such a way that the app name and the version number are clear in the filename. No more looking into ~/Downloads/ and seeing "download.dmg" or “pf.zip" and having to try to guess or remember what apps those are, or if they are apps at all.

## Advanced Options

If you combine these scripts with [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), you could create a macro which will check for the update of an app after that app quits, which will minimize disruptions. (My biggest complaint about Sparkle updates is that they almost always interrupt you right after you just started to use an app, which is possibly the worst time to be interrupted.)

## Disclaimers and “Ones To Watch”

While it’s not particularly _likely_, it is _possible_ that any of these scripts could stop working for any number of reasons. 

However, a few of them are more likely than others.

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) - has a silent self-updater, so it’s not a huge concern, but my method for checking the latest version of Dropbox is very fragile.
* [BusyCal](http://www.busymac.com/busycal/) and [BusyContacts](http://www.busymac.com/busycontacts/) - updating them causes an “Open” dialog to appear, for reasons which are unclear to me. I assume it has something to do with sandboxing, but I’m not sure. I’m also not sure what to do about it, so I just hit `ESC` whenever that happens.
